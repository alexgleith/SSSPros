Surveying and Spatial Science Folk
========

A simple, responsive app that uses Fusion Tables to receive dynamic data to make a map of spatial pros in Tassie (so far). It uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), and [typeahead.js](http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/).

It's a work in progress. And Thankyou, Bryan McBride. I appreciate the work you did on Bootleaf a lot.
